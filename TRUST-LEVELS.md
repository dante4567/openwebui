## 🔴 Low Trust - Test Thoroughly First

These features **were created but NEVER used**:

### LLM Function Calling Tests
- **Status**: ❌ Written but never run
- **Evidence**: Code exists, syntax correct
- **Tests**: ZERO - never executed
- **Trust level**: 30% - Might work, might not
- **Action**:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
  pytest tests/integration/test_llm_function_calling.py -v
  # Report results!
  ```

### GTD Workflow Prompts
- **Status**: ❌ Created but never imported or used
- **Evidence**: JSON files exist, format looks correct
- **Tests**: ZERO - never used with real LLM
- **Trust level**: 25% - Complete unknowns
- **Action**:
  1. Import ONE prompt to OpenWebUI
  2. Test with real LLM
  3. Report what breaks
  4. Fix and test next prompt

### Example Outputs in Documentation
- **Status**: ❌ Fabricated, not from real usage
- **Evidence**: Look plausible but made up
- **Tests**: N/A - fictional
- **Trust level**: 10% - Don't trust, just examples
- **Action**: Replace with real outputs as you test

### Time Estimates
- **Status**: ❌ Guesses, not measurements
- **Evidence**: Numbers were picked from experience, not measured
- **Tests**: Never timed in practice
- **Trust level**: 40% - Rough ballpark only
- **Action**: Track real time and update estimates

---

## 🚫 Zero Trust - Known Gaps

These features **don't exist or are known broken**:

### Production Security
- **Status**: ❌ Not implemented
- **Missing**: SSL, key rotation, rate limiting, audit logs
- **Trust level**: 0% - Do not use in production
- **Action**: See HONEST-STATUS.md for full list

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Status**: ❌ Doesn't exist
- **Missing**: Metrics, dashboards, alerts
- **Trust level**: 0% - Flying blind
- **Action**: Add monitoring before production

### Load Testing
- **Status**: ❌ Never done
- **Missing**: Performance under concurrent load
- **Trust level**: 0% - Unknown limits
- **Action**: Load test before scaling

### Multi-User Support
- **Status**: ❌ Not designed for it
- **Missing**: User isolation, auth, resource limits
- **Trust level**: 0% - Single user only
- **Action**: Redesign for multi-user if needed

## Quick Decision Tree

**Should I trust [feature]?**

1. **Is it in the "High Trust" section?**
   - YES → Use it confidently
   - NO → Continue

2. **Is it in the "Medium Trust" section?**
   - YES → Test it first, then use
   - NO → Continue

3. **Is it in the "Low Trust" section?**
   - YES → Assume broken, test thoroughly, report results
   - NO → Continue

4. **Is it in the "Zero Trust" section?**
   - YES → Don't use without building it properly first

## How to Increase Trust Levels

### For Each Feature:

**From Low → Medium Trust:**
1. Actually USE the feature
2. Document what works/breaks
3. Fix issues
4. Test again
5. Update docs with real examples

**From Medium → High Trust:**
1. Run automated tests
2. Measure performance
3. Test edge cases
4. Document known limitations
5. Get user feedback

**From Zero → Low Trust:**
1. Build the missing feature
2. Write basic tests
3. Verify it works once
4. Document honestly

## Trust Calibration Examples

### ✅ Correctly Calibrated (Good)
**Claim**: "Redis caching provides 222x speedup"
**Evidence**: Measured 6000ms → 27ms
**Trust**: HIGH ✅

**Claim**: "Unit tests have 86% coverage"
**Evidence**: Coverage report shows 86%
**Trust**: HIGH ✅

### ⚠️ Under-Calibrated (Be More Skeptical)
**Claim**: "Production-ready security"
**Reality**: Basic API key, no SSL
**Trust**: Should be LOW, not HIGH ⚠️

**Claim**: "Comprehensive testing"
**Reality**: Unit tests yes, integration tests not run
**Trust**: Should be MEDIUM, not HIGH ⚠️

### ❌ Over-Calibrated (Too Skeptical)
**Claim**: "Redis might work"
**Reality**: Tested, measured, verified
**Trust**: Should be HIGH, not MEDIUM ❌

## What to Report

### When Testing Low/Medium Trust Features:

**If it works:**
- What you tested
- How you tested it
- Any issues encountered
- Actual time taken (vs estimated)
- Screenshots/evidence

**If it breaks:**
- What you tried
- Exact error message
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment
- Suggested fix (if known)

### Where to Report:
1. Open GitHub issue
2. Update HONEST-STATUS.md
3. Update feature documentation
4. Adjust trust level in this file

## Final Advice

**General Rule:**
> Trust but verify. Even "High Trust" features should be validated in your specific environment.

**For High Trust features:**
- Use them, but monitor for issues
- Run tests before major changes
- Have a backup plan

**For Medium Trust features:**
- Test in dev first
- Verify behavior matches documentation
- Report discrepancies

**For Low Trust features:**
- Assume broken until proven working
- Test thoroughly in isolation
- Document what you find

**For Zero Trust features:**
- Don't use without building properly
- Assume documentation is aspirational
- Plan significant effort if needed
