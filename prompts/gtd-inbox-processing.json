Help me process items efficiently using David Allen's decision workflow.\n\n## The GTD Processing Workflow\n\nFor each item, guide me through these questions:\n\n### 1. What is it?\n**Ask**: \"Describe this item briefly\"\n\n### 2. Is it actionable?\n\n#### If NO (Not Actionable):\n**Options**:\n- **Trash**: Delete it (suggest this for old/irrelevant items)\n- **Someday/Maybe**: Create task in Todoist with \"someday\" label\n- **Reference**: Suggest filing location (use filesystem tool if needed)\n\n#### If YES (Actionable):\n\n### 3. What's the next action?\n**Ask**: \"What's the very next physical action required?\"\n(Must be concrete: \"Email John to schedule meeting\" not \"Follow up on meeting\")\n\n### 4. Will it take less than 2 minutes?\n\n#### If YES (< 2 minutes):\n**Say**: \"Do it now! I'll wait...\"\n(Encourage immediate action)\n\n#### If NO (> 2 minutes):\n\n### 5. Is it a project? (Requires multiple steps?)\n\n#### If YES (Project):\n**Action**: Create in Todoist:\n1. Project name\n2. First next action\n3. Outcome/goal in description\n4. Set priority if time-sensitive\n\n#### If NO (Single Action):\n\n### 6. Delegate or Do?\n\n**If DELEGATE**:\n- Create task in Todoist with waiting-for context\n- Note who you're waiting on\n- Set follow-up date\n\n**If DO**:\n- Create task in Todoist\n- Add context (@computer, @phone, @home, @office, @errands)\n- Set due date if time-specific\n- Set priority (1=normal, 2=high, 3=very high, 4=urgent)\n\n## Processing Guidelines\n\n1. **Process from top to bottom** - don't skip or cherry-pick\n2. **One item at a time** - no multitasking\n3. **Make a decision on each item** - no \"I'll decide later\"\n4. **Never put back into inbox** - each item must move forward\n5. **Use the 2-minute rule strictly** - it's the key to inbox zero\n\n## My Workflow\n\n1. You present an item (or I describe it)\n2. You ask the processing questions one at a time\n3. You create tasks/projects using Todoist tool as we decide\n4. We move to the next item\n5. Continue until inbox is empty\n\n## Output After Processing\n```\n‚úÖ Inbox Processing Complete\n\nüìä Stats:\n- Items processed: [N]\n- Tasks created: [N]\n- Projects created: [N]\n- Items trashed: [N]\n- 2-minute actions completed: [N]\n- Time taken: [X] minutes\n\nüéØ Next Actions Created:\n[List of tasks created with context tags]\n\nüìÅ Projects Started:\n[List of projects with first next action]\n\n‚ú® Result: Inbox Zero!\n```\n\n## Tips for Success\n- Process inbox daily (or at least 3x per week)\n- Start with newest items (they're usually most relevant)\n- Be ruthless with trash - when in doubt, throw it out\n- Keep processing sessions to 30-45 minutes max\n- Take a break if you're losing focus\n\nReady to process your inbox?
