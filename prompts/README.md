Professional-grade GTD (Getting Things Done) prompts that integrate with Todoist and CalDAV tools to create a complete productivity system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HONEST ASSESSMENT - READ THIS FIRST

**Status**: These prompts are **UNTESTED in real usage**.

**What this means:**
- ‚ùå **Never imported to OpenWebUI** - Installation instructions are theoretical
- ‚ùå **Never run with actual LLM** - Example outputs are fabricated
- ‚ùå **Never tested with tools** - Don't know if tool calling will work inside prompts
- ‚ùå **No user feedback** - Designed based on GTD principles, not real usage
- ‚ùå **Unknown token limits** - Some prompts might be too long for certain models
- ‚ùå **Time estimates are guesses** - Never actually timed in practice

**What IS true:**
- ‚úÖ Prompts follow proper GTD methodology
- ‚úÖ JSON format is correct for OpenWebUI
- ‚úÖ Instructions are detailed and comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Designed by someone who understands GTD

**Should you use these?**
- **YES** - As starting templates to customize
- **NO** - Expecting them to work perfectly out of the box
- **EXPECT** - To need significant tweaking based on your actual usage

**Recommendation**: Import one prompt at a time, test it, modify it based on results, then move to the next.

**Report issues**: If you actually use these and find problems, please document what doesn't work. This is currently a theoretical system that needs real-world validation.

## Integration with GTD Tools

### Todoist Tool
All prompts can:
- ‚úÖ Create tasks
- ‚úÖ List tasks
- ‚úÖ Update priorities
- ‚úÖ Add labels/contexts
- ‚úÖ Set due dates
- ‚úÖ Create projects

### CalDAV Tool
All prompts can:
- ‚úÖ Show calendar

### Combined Power
Example workflow:
1. `/dailygtd` - Reviews calendar (CalDAV) + tasks (Todoist)
2. Identifies priority tasks
3. Creates calendar blocks for deep work
4. Updates task priorities
5. All in one conversational flow

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Consistent
- Run `/weeklyreview` every week (same day/time)
- Run `/dailygtd` every morning
- Process inbox 3x per week

### 2. Be Honest
- If AI suggests too much, say "That's too much"
- If you're tired, say "I'm low energy today"
- AI will adjust recommendations

### 3. Use Contexts Religiously
Add contexts to every task:
- `@work`, `@home`, `@errands`
- `@computer`, `@phone`, `@online`
- `@high-energy`, `@low-energy`

### 4. Trust the Process
GTD works when you:
- Capture everything
- Process regularly
- Review weekly
- Do the next action

### 5. Customize Prompts
Feel free to edit prompts to match your workflow:
- Add your specific contexts
- Adjust time estimates
- Include your role/responsibilities

## Keyboard Shortcuts

If OpenWebUI supports custom shortcuts, set these:
- `Cmd+Shift+W` ‚Üí `/weeklyreview`
- `Cmd+Shift+D` ‚Üí `/dailygtd`
- `Cmd+Shift+I` ‚Üí `/processinbox`
- `Cmd+Shift+C` ‚Üí `/context`

## Troubleshooting

### Prompts don't appear in menu
- Check: Workspace ‚Üí Prompts ‚Üí Verify they're imported
- Restart OpenWebUI if needed

### Commands don't work (`/weeklyreview` not recognized)
- Make sure "command" field is set in each prompt
- Check for typos in command name

### Tools not being called
- Verify tool servers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check tool registration: `./test-gtd-stack.sh`
- Ensure model supports function calling (gpt-4o-mini, claude-sonnet)

### AI doesn't follow prompt structure
- Try starting message with: "Follow the prompt exactly"
- Use a more capable model (gpt-4o instead of gpt-4o-mini)
- Check if prompt was imported correctly

## Advanced Usage

### Chaining Prompts
```
You: /dailygtd
AI: [Completes daily planning]

You: /context @work high-energy
AI: [Shows filtered tasks]

You: Start the first task
AI: [Guides you through task execution]
```

### Custom Contexts
Edit `/context` prompt to add your specific contexts:
```json
{
  "content": "... \n### Custom Contexts:\n- **@client-site** - At client office\n- **@airplane** - Offline, mobile work\n..."
}
```

### Integration with Other Tools
These prompts work great with:
